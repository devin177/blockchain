Hello! This is my way of trying to learn how blockchains and cryptocurrencies work.

### Ideas for expanding on this

1. Build a fleshed-out POW Coin

2. Build a POS Coin

3. Use blockchain to vote? Secure because votes are immutable

### Update 6/22/2021

- I have learned a lot about this topic over the last few days, but I am getting confused by trying to understand too many things about the blockchain at once. So, I'm going to set a plan in motion.

1. Set up the basic blockchain data structure (Using an in-memory vector as my blockchain)

2. Set up a basic web server to allow others to connect to this (singular at the moment node)
 - Addendum: Implement a function that changes things to JSON

3. Change the way the blockchain is actually stored/learn how to write and format the ".dat" files that bitcoin seems to use

4. Multiple Nodes/conflicting blockchains/etc. problems
